# Loan-Analysis-Report

I created an advanced bank loan data analysis dashboard to provide dynamic and comprehensive insights into lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance. The executive summary dashboard focused on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amounts, received payments, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. The main idea was to enhance decision-making by offering an interactive and data-driven approach to assessing financial health, identifying trends, and optimizing lending strategies.
